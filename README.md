# Haberman’s Cancer Survival: Visual Exploratory Data Analysis using Python

The objective of this project is to perform an EDA that will structure your thoughts in the entire analysis. Here the objective is to predict whether the patient will survive after 5 years based on the patient’s age, year of treatment, and the number of positive lymph nodes.

Haberman’s survival data set contains cases from a study conducted between 1958 and 1970 at the University of Chicago’s Billings Hospital on the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer.

Attribute Information:

Age of patient at the time of operation (numerical)
Patient’s year of operation (year — 1900, numerical)
Number of positive auxiliary nodes detected (numerical)

Survival status (class attribute) 
  1 = The patient survived 5 years or longer 
  2 = The patient died within 5 years
